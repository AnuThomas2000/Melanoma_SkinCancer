# Project Name
> This project is aimed at building a Custom CNN model to accurately detect skin cancer called melanoma from images. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Use the image files available to classify them into various category of skin cancers
- What is the background of your project? Skin Cancer detection
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? Early detection of skin cancer called Melanoma from skin images
- What is the dataset that is being used? The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
